    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There is plenty of material online that will help you figure out how to do various tasks on the command line. Commands you may need to know today:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ls`: lists the contents of the current directory.\n",
    "* `pwd`: prints the path of the current directory.\n",
    "* `cd <directory>`: changes your current directory to the specified directory.\n",
    "* `cd ..`: changes current directory to the previous directory. Basically steps out of the current directory to the directory containing the current directory.\n",
    "* `mkdir <directory>`: create a new directory with the specified name.\n",
    "* `rmdir <directory>`: removes the specified directory. Note it has to be empty.\n",
    "* `rm <filename>`: deletes the specified file.\n",
    "* `mv <filename 1> <filename 2>`: Moves or renames a file.\n",
    "* `cp <filename 1> <filename 2>`: copies an file. If you just provide a path to a directory, it copies the file into that directory with the same filename. If you specifiy a new filename, the copy has a new name. For example `cp File.1.txt File.2.txt` creates a copy of `File.1.txt` with the name `File.2.txt`. Meanwhile `cp File.1.txt my_directory`, where `my_directory` is a directory, creates a copy of `File.1.txt` in directory `my_directory` with the name `File.1.txt`.\n",

    "### Setup and Submission (During Lab 4 Session on 2/6/26)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our course repository is public. The instructions here aim to have you setup a fork of the course repository. Unfortunately because you are forking a public repo, your fork will have to be public also.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar with git from the first semester of this course. I assume that you all have github accounts and have setup things to be able to [push to github using ssh](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). The instuctions here lead you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll overview what you will do before going through step by step instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup:\n",
    "    1. Fork the class repository. Some directions in [fork-a-repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).\n",
    "    1. Create a directory on your personal system where you will keep all course materials.\n",
    "    1. In that directory, clone your fork of the repository.\n",
    "    1. Using `git remote`, set the upstream to be the class repo, so you can pull from the class and push to your fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submission:\n",
    "    1. Copy your solutions into the appropriate directory (e.g. into `Labs/Lab.2/`) and with appropriate filename `Lab.2.solution.ipynb'.\n",
    "    1. Commit / push your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are step by step instructions with examples (including example directory naming convention). Feel free to modify things as you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "You should only need to follow this instructions once. Here are some useful git commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Git help: `git help`\n",
    "* Git remote help: `git help remote`\n",
    "* Check remote status: `git remote -v`\n",
    "* Add a remote: `git remote add <stream name> <repo URL>`\n",
    "* Add a remove: `git remote remove <stream name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. In a browser, log into GitHub and navigate to the [course repository](https://github.com/UTA-DataScience/DATA3402.Spring.2025).\n",
    "1. On the top right of the page, press the fork button to create a new fork into your own GitHub account.\n",
    "1. After successful fork, you should find the browser showing your fork of the course repository. Use the green \"Code\" button to copy path to the repo into your the clipboard of your computer.\n",
    "1. Open a shell on your personal computer.\n",
    "1. If you have not done so already, create a new directory/folder where you will keep all course material to navigate to it. For example: `mkdir Data-3402` and `cd Data-3402`.\n",
    "1. Clone your fork of the repository using `git clone` followed by the path you copied into your clipboard. (copy/paste)\n",
    "1. Paste the URL to your fork in the worksheet for the TAs and instructors.\n",
    "1. Now go into the directory of your clone (`cd DATA3402.Spring.2026`).\n",
    "1. Type `git remote -v` to see the current setup for fetch and pull.\n",
    "1. Note the URL you see. This should be the same as what you used for your clone for both push and fetch.\n",
    "1. Delete the origin remote using `git remote remove origin`.\n",
    "1. Add the course repo as your remote using `git remote add origin https://github.com/UTA-DataScience/DATA3402.Spring.2026.git`.\n",
    "1. Change the push to point to your fork. This means you will need the URL to your clone we copied earlier and confirmed as the original origin. The command will look something like: `git remote set-url --push origin  https://github.com/XXXXXX/DATA3402.Spring.2026.git`, where XXXXX is your username on GitHub.\n",
    "1. Note that if you setup everything correctly, you now should be able to do `git pull` to get updates from the course repo, and do `git push` to push your commits into your own fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "These instructions outline how you submit files. Some useful commands:\n",
    "* To add a file to local repository: `git add <file>`.\n",
    "* To commit all changed files into local repository: `git -a -m \"A message\"`. You need to provide some comment when you commit.\n",
    "* To push the commited files from the local repository to GitHub: `git push`.\n",
    "* To get updates from GitHub: `git pull`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. To submit your labs, navigate to your clone of your fork of the course repository.\n",
    "1. Use `git pull` to make sure you have the latest updates.\n",
    "1. Make sure your copy of the lab your are working on is in the appropriate place in this clone. That means if you have the file elsewhere, copy it to the same directory in your clone of your fork.\n",
    "1. Note that in order to avoid future conflicts, you should always name your solution differently than the original file in the class repo. For example if your file is still named `Lab.2.ipynb` you should rename it using the `mv` command: `mv Lab.2.ipynb Lab.2.solution.ipynb`.\n",
    "1. Add and files you wish to submit into the repo. For example: `git add Labs/Lab.2/Lab.2.solution.ipynb`\n",
    "1. Commit any changes: `git commit -a -m \"Lab 2 updates\"`\n",
    "1. Push your changes: `git push`\n",
    "1. Check on github website that your solutions have been properly submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you leave the session on Friday 2/6/26, make sure your GitHub Repo is setup. If you need to work further on your lab, navigate jupyter to the copy of the lab you just submitted and work there. Once done, repeat the commit and push commands to submit your updated solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that lab 2 is due by midnight Friday 2/6/2025.\n"

    "Hint: A simple, but slow, solution is to a draw random number `test_x` within the specified range and another number `p` between the `min` and `max` of the function (which you will have to determine). If `p<=function(test_x)`, then place `test_x` on the output. If not, repeat the process, drawing two new numbers. Repeat until you have the specified number of generated numbers, `N`. For this problem, it's OK to determine the `min` and `max` by numerically sampling the function.  "
